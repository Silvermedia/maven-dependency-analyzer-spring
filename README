Introduction
------------

This project enhances the Maven Dependency Plugin 

http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin

by adding support for extracing dependency information
from a project's Spring XML files.

When enabled, a project's resources and test resources (usually located
in src/main/resources and src/test/resources) will be scanned for Spring XML files and all
bean definitions will be considered as project dependencies as well.

Requirements
------------

Java JDK 1.5+ (both for compiling AND RUNNING the plugin)
Maven 2.2.1+ (older versions will probably work as well)

Compiling and installing
------------------------

To actually get the maven-dependency-plugin to support the new ProjectDependencyAnalyzer,
you currently need to manually patch and 'mvn install' both

maven-dependency-analyzer  1.1 (http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/shared/tags/maven-dependency-analyzer-1.1)
maven-dependency-plugin 2.1 (http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/plugins/tags/maven-dependency-plugin-2.1)

using the patch files in the top-level directory.

I'm trying to get the Maven guys to accept my patches but 
since I'm new to Maven plugin development the code will 
most likely need some more work (if it gets accepted at all).

Usage
-----

The patched & installed maven-dependency-plugin currently has version 2.1-SNAPSHOT.

To enable the new feature (scanning dependencies in Spring XMLs) , you 
need to pass an 'includeSpringXmls=true' property to the plugin (either
using '-DincludeSpringXmls=true' on the command-line or by adding it as 
a plugin configuration in your pom.xml).

To use the patched snapshot version you need to either 
specify the version number on the command-line

mvn -DincludeSpringXmls=true org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin:2.1-SNAPSHOT:<goal>
 
or declare the maven-dependency-plugin in your pom.xml using the following
XML snippet:

--->8---->8---
<build>
  <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <configuration>
          <includeSpringXmls>true</includeSpringXmls>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
