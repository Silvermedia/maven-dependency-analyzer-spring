Introduction
------------

This project enhances the Maven Dependency Plugin 

http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin

by adding support for extracing dependency information
from a project's Spring XML files.

When enabled, a project's resources and test resources (usually located
in src/main/resources and src/test/resources) will be scanned for Spring XML files and all
bean definitions will be considered as project dependencies as well.

Requirements
------------

Java JDK 1.5+ (both for compiling AND RUNNING the plugin)
Maven 2.2.1+ (older versions will probably work as well)

Compiling and installing
------------------------

To actually get the maven-dependency-plugin to support this extension:

1. Patch and mvn install maven-dependency-analyzer 1.1

svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/shared/tags/maven-dependency-analyzer-1.1 maven-dependency-analyzer
cd maven-dependency-analyzer 
patch -p0 -F3 <maven-dependency-analyzer_1.1.patch
mvn install

2. Patch and mvn install maven-dependency-plugin 2.1

svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/plugins/tags/maven-dependency-plugin-2.1 maven-dependency-plugin
cd maven-dependency-plugin
patch -p0 <maven-dependency-plugin_2.1.patch
mvn install

3. Install maven-dependency-analyzer-spring

cd maven-dependency-analyzer-spring 
mvn install

I'm trying to get the Maven guys to accept my patches but 
since I'm new to Maven plugin development the code will 
most likely need some more work (if it gets accepted at all).

Usage
-----

The patched & installed maven-dependency-plugin currently has version 2.1-SNAPSHOT.

To enable scanning Spring XMLs for dependencies you need to add 
this project's artifact as a dependency of the maven-dependency-plugin 
*AND* set the plugin'S new 'analyzer' property to value 'spring'. 

Declare the maven-dependency-plugin in your pom.xml using the following
XML snippet:

--->8---->8---
<build>
  <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>de.codesourcery.maven.shared</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-dependency-analyzer-spring</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
        <configuration>
          <analyzer>spring</analyzer>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
--->8---->8---

When running 'mvn dependency:analyze' on a project
with Spring XMLs , you should see the following output:

[INFO] Including dependencies from Spring XMLs in analysis
[INFO] Scanned Spring XML < ... Spring XML file ... >
